The main principle involved is Helmet Detection using Deep Learning at three levels. The objects detected are person, motorcycle/moped at first level using YOLOv2, helmet at second level using YOLOv3, License plate at the last level using YOLOv2. Then the license plate registration number is extracted using OCR.
